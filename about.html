                                        <h3>The Alliance for Surgery and Anesthesia Presence (ASAP)</h3>

                                        <p>The ASAP was founded in 2007 and registered in Switzerland as an international organization
                                            and integral part of the World Society of Surgery (WSS) to provide an international
                                            forum for exchanging information, developing new knowledge, and advocating for
                                            universal access to safe, timely, affordable anesthesia and emergency and essential
                                            surgical care globally, especially in low and middle-income countries and other
                                            high need areas. The mission of ASAP is to provide the evidence base to effectively
                                            advocate for access to safe, quality, timely surgery and anesthesia as an essential
                                            component of global public health.</p>
                                        <h3>The Rwanda Surgical Society</h3>
                                        <p>Rwanda Surgical Society (RSS) was formed in 2007 and it has a mandate to improve
                                            surgical care to Rwandan population and to improve the welfare of surgeons. RSS
                                            also operates as a COSECSA local chapter. Rwanda surgical society is involved
                                            in surgical education of Rwandan and through different programs; we provide basic
                                            surgical training to non-Surgeons physicians. The Rwanda Surgical Society will
                                            host the 2018 COSECSA conference in Kigali, Rwanda. The conference will offer
                                            researchers, surgical care providers, policy makers from all over the world,
                                            interested in the field of global surgery, a platform to discuss surgical infections
                                            and access to safe surgery, anesthesia and obstetrics. </p>
                                        <h3>Surgical Infections</h3>
                                        <p>Surgical infections threaten the lives of millions of patients each year and contribute
                                            to the spread of antibiotic resistance worldwide. In low- and middle-income countries,
                                            11% of patients who undergo surgery are infected and up to 20% of women who have
                                            a caesarean section contract a wound infection. Worldwide, surgical infections
                                            contribute to increased length of hospital stay and cost. In low-and middle-income
                                            countries, infections are not only caused by surgery, but also are the indications
                                            of Surgery. Of every 100 hospitalized patients at any given time, seven in developed
                                            and 15 in developing countries will acquire at least one Health care Associated
                                            Infection (HAI). The endemic burden of HAI is also significantly (at least 2-3
                                            times) higher in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) than in high-income
                                            nations, particularly in patients admitted to intensive care units, and neonates.
                                            Though the World Health Organization has launched the international guidelines
                                            on prevention of surgical sites infections in 2016, there is still limited data
                                            from low and middle-income countries in the field of surgical infection. Researchers
                                            will bring together their experience of global surgical infections issues that
                                            will guide the practice and generate new avenues for research especially in Africa</p>
                                        <h3>Global Surgery</h3>
                                        <p>Global Surgery is defined as an area of study, research, practice, and advocacy that
                                            seeks to improve health outcomes and achieve health equity for all people who
                                            need surgical and anesthesia care, with a special emphasis on underserved populations
                                            and populations in crisis. It uses collaborative, cross-sectoral, and transnational
                                            approaches and is a synthesis of population-based strategies with individual
                                            surgical and anesthesia care
                                            <br>The health care delivery has improved throughout the world, however there
                                            is still a huge gap in certain areas like management of surgically treatable
                                            conditions. More than five billion people worldwide cannot access safe, timely
                                            and affordable surgery. There is inequity of the distribution of surgical care
                                            where 30% of the population from rich countries receive 73.6% of the surgical
                                            procedures while the poorest third receives only 3.5 to 6%. Even within countries,
                                            the maximum number of surgeons and anesthesia providers are concentrated in urban
                                            areas. Global health in the past has focused on single diseases, rather than
                                            developing integrated health system. Surgical care has been neglected in developing
                                            countries, yet surgery is an important solution to many diseases.
                                            <br>To improve access to surgical care, the Lancet Commission on Global Surgery
                                            has established a framework for a National Surgical, Anesthesia and Obstetrics
                                            plan (NSAOP) that addresses five major domains of surgical systems development:
                                            infrastructure, workforce, service delivery, information management, and financing.
                                            Each domain consists of several components, selected to be representative but
                                            not exhaustive elements for systems development within that domain. The World
                                            Health Organization General Assembly in May 2015 adopted the Resolution 68.15
                                            requesting all countries to integrate safe surgery, anesthesia and obstetrics
                                            in their health strategic plans as an integral part of Universal Health Coverage
                                            (UHC). It is in that context that the Rwanda Ministry of Health in partnership
                                            with the Rwanda Surgical Society and the Harvard Medical School Program in Global
                                            Surgery and Social Change (PGSSC) conducted a baseline hospital assessment and
                                            drafted the Rwanda NSAOP. The national surgical plan will serve as a roadmap
                                            towards improving surgical care provision to the population of Rwanda.
                                            <br>Countries, international organizations, healthcare industries will have a
                                            whole day session presenting the NSAOPs, assessing the progress by the early
                                            implementers and allowing others to learn from their experience.
